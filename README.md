# HomePlotter
This project contains a Python project which allows the user to plot points in feet/inches and calculate diagonals from two points, the origin, and the "basis" point.

The diagonals are useful for mapping the plan of a home onto a physical location, as it prevents compounding errors and allows you to easily and accurately position each point of a home by running a measuring tape from the "origin" corner and "basis" corner.

For each point:
- D1 is your diagonal from the origin
- D2 is your diagonal from the basis point


## How to use:

Start by placing a stake for the origin, followed by a stake for your basis point, at a distance equal to that represented in the program. 

Run two tape measures, from the origin and basis. For each point, place a stake at the intersection of the diagonal measurements. By the magic of the ✨Pythagorean Theorem✨, this stake is now accurately placed relative to your basis and origin.
